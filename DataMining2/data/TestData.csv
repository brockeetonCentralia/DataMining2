2801260,2,missing,United Kingdom,"We've just come back from a couple of days at Eurodisney. I agree with a previous review writer that to the staff at Eurodisney its just a job, whereas at Orlando they do the job because they actually like to do it. That's not belittling all the staff at Paris as some where very helpful, albeit they seemed in the minority.We weren't warned that some of the rides were closed and the fast path tickets ran out early afternoon. Additionally we couldn't get a Park Guide in English as they had all ran out! We booked our tickets over the internet direct with Disney which failed to arrive and we waited 40 minutes to be given replacements on the day. Having been to Disney at Florida early this year perhaps gave us an unfair comparison.Whilst writing   does anyone know what the Halloween song was that was played?We didn't feel that the Park had the same Disney feel as Florida, true it was Halloween there but you could have been anywhere. There were very few characters going around.Having said all that   of course we will go again!!!",Disneyland_Paris
2784351,4,missing,Australia,"Just returned from Disneyland Paris. We loved it   especially the Halloween theme throughout the Park. The queues for rides were, well, long, but we had expected that. We found that if you go to some of the rides just prior to closing (rides closed at 8pm so between 7.30 and 8) you can just get on because everyone seemed to be leaving the Park. Food was fine. We ate lunch at the Mexican Cantina (our food was hot and there wasn't a great queue although we waited until about 1.30pm to have lunch). We had our dinner at the Silver Spur Steakhouse. Meal was excellent. We used the baby facilities and they were clean with everything you need.",Disneyland_Paris
2718239,1,missing,United States,"Having spent three days at the Disneyland Paris resort, I have nothing but praise for the Park, the entertainers, and the sheer magic of the Park. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, and it was superb..My only complaint is with the food in the actual Park, huge lines, expensive, and the food was stone cold..The Disney name stands for quality, tradition, and is known the world over for it's love of children, and keeping the magic alive. Why would Disney endorse this dreadful food? If Disney needs to put the emphasis, and focus on the entertainment, hotels, etc, (Which it does with the most amazing stunning detail, quality, and perfection) Why can't you put the horrible food, served under your name and flagship, out to tender? McDonalds would be better than stone cold food..slow service, and disappointment.  This is the ONLY aspect that gives cause for complaint, and it does take some of the magic away..and leave a nasty taste..literally.",Disneyland_Paris
2607513,2,missing,Switzerland,"The parades were great, but the bathrooms were filthy.  Could it be that Disney is trying too hard to cut its costs, not staffing the park sufficiently?",Disneyland_Paris
2600220,5,missing,United Kingdom,"I visited in Sept 2004, staying 3 nights at the Disneyland Hotel. I had read so many forums on the internet about the accommodation that I decided to spend the extra & stay there & I don't regret it! It was luxury and the location was brilliant with a toddler who needed her afternoon nap! The characters were around at breakfast & the breakfast itself was great   plenty of food & selection. No queues in the park, which was great. OK, things were expensive, but I expected that. In the Disney Village, the best restaurant in our experience was the Rainforest Cafe. Dinner was no more expensive than in Ireland, service & food great. We also tried the Steakhouse, but had a bad meal & bad service. We had a brilliant holiday.",Disneyland_Paris
2509761,4,missing,Guernsey,I went there in the middle of August. Having been to the one in California I was looking forward to seeing what differences they had.Expect to queue for everything. That was a bit of a pain. And watch out for queue jumpers I was told the French do it alot and they really do. You have to pretty much block their path to stop them. But I found this was the same for everywhere in Paris.The rides were great especially thundermountain railway. The haunted mansion broke down for at least 20 minutes while we were on the ride. Wasn't too bad cause it was a very hot day and being in an air conditioned room was not bad.All in all a great day out.,Disneyland_Paris
2506710,2,missing,United States,"I will start off by saying that comments around the non Disney things are mostly negative. Not because I'm biased but b c they honestly were frustrating, unclean, or awful...sometimes all of the above. :( DLP itself was nice but NO comparsion to WDW in Orlando...didn't have the same feel, the same level of commitment from its staff, nor the same visitor enthusiasm (we only saw 3 other people besides us wearing Disney gear there). However, I must say that the Disney store itemsthey had were great, but I haven't seen the ones in Orlando for a yr now.EUROSTAR: We arrived by Eurostar (hi speed via the chunnel) from London's Waterloo station...nice ride. Filthy train, and we were in first class (stains all over the seats and floor; the bathroom lookedas if it had never been cleaned and the toilet paper was the equivalent of newspaper). They served a snack that consisted of a small can of OJ, ham cheese sandwich, croissant, yogurt and cereal bar. I know the company is struggling and now I know why. First class is NOT worth the $100 dollar upgrade.The Eurostar ends at Disneyland Paris. So, when you exit the station there's Disney Village, Disney Studios and Disneyland...very convenient. This is also the bus depot to all the hotels.HOLIDAY INN: From there we got on the bus to the Holiday Inn. Ok, why someone didn't remind me that we're going to Disney and the HI is NOT Disney I'll never know. For some reason it's rated higher than the Newport Bay club Sequoia on the Disney site (I'll never understand why...it is NOT a deluxe hotel by any stretch...the lobby alone is NOcomparison to the Disney hotel lobbies at DLP)...but between the rating and the $600 savings by booking directly via the HI inn website that's why we chose it. Believe me when I tell you that Iwould have paid more than $600 to avoid the buses at all costs and stay at a Disney hotel that's walking distance to the parks and train!! Not to mention that the hotel is 'cold' in its feel, extremely noisy, and much understaffed. We spent a great deal of time each day waiting in line to ask questions at the front desk. We often had to call several times to follow up on requests to housekeeping for iron requests. The rooms were on the small side for the money although the bathrooms were a decent size. Our room (Family Room) had a queen bed and a set of bunk beds along with a crib...it was crowded. I understand the 'Kid Suites' are a 2 room set up and much larger.BUSES: The bus transportation to Disney property but non Disney hotels was awful. The drivers never spoke a word, not even to tell you which hotel he just abruptly stopped at forcing you to become onewith the window or your neighbor, and heaven forbid he ever offered assistance. The drivers would fill the buses beyond capacity and then drive as if they were a Nascar racer. No, I'm not exaggerating. Not to mention the wait at the depot.SAD BUS EXAMPLE: Once my husband rode the bus alone to the Village to get some food and bring it back to the room (my son and I were in the room sick with some awful flu bug so he wanted to be in the room to take care of us and our daughter who didn't catch it...the HI REFUSED to let him takeaway the dinner food  although they let you do so with breakfast  which forced him to go to the Disney village). Upon returning he squeezed on the bus and was followed by a mother pushing her daughter in a wheelchair. My husband attempted to help, with baked potatoes in hand, no one else would assist the mother or my husband. The woman shouted to the driver 'you're supposed to lower the ramp!', he never did. Never said a word, nor did and of the other tourists (really, it was for the most part the most rude group of tourists I have ever been confined with). This forced the poor girl to crawl out of the chair and up into the bus. When it was time for the woman to get off a man next to my husband said, 'glad she's gone, she was grumpy'. Luckily the woman was w in earshot and returned to inform the man that her daughter has terminal cancer and that this was her last holiday. That about sums up all of our frustrating and sad bus experiences.PARKS: The parks are a bit smaller, but still very enjoyable. We were in no way park commandos, just out for a trip to see another part of Disney. I will offer this important show TIP...the Legend of the Lion King show always had a line of 1 2 hrs and sold out every time. Not wanting to wait in theline we went to lunch in the adjoining building, Hyperion Cafe. Low and behold they are the same building. Get your food, get a seat and watch the show while you eat!!!! You actually eat your meal a few rows above people that have just stood in line for 2 hrs and are likely tired and hungry by now! Note that they will not let you sit without your food.DISNEYLAND HOTEL: We stopped in the Disneyland hotel, which is actually part of the grand entrance to DLP. The hotel inside was beautiful and the staff so friendly. We wanted to cry when we walkedin...we should have followed our guts and changed hotels from the moment we arrived at the HI like we wanted to.DISNEYS NEWPORT BAY CLUB HOTEL: From there we walked over to the Newport Bay Club, which is thru the Disney Village. Again, we walked in here and felt 'home'! We thought we were back in Orlando. Again, tears. The staff was friendly. Of the staff we encountered there was some language barrier which surprised us, although most werestill helpful, except for the concierge. We had dinner at their more casual restaurant and it was wonderful. They have a fantastic kids buffet, which was so nice for them to have so many options.DISNEY VILLAGE: Much smaller than Downtown Disney in Orlando, much smaller. Mostly restaurants and counter service. We ate at the Chicago Steakhouse...great food, great atmosphere!PRIORITY SEATING: Of all the times we made reservations we had our pick of times, even at the last minute. I'm really not sure where everyone else was eating! The restaurants were EMPTY!!PARIS: We also took the RER train to Paris for a day and walked a lot...GREAT Disney store at the Champs Elsyees!!! Good ride, about 45 min.So, all in all a good trip, if we take out the HI and the buses. :) I would HIGHLY recommend staying at a Disney hotel (park passes are included in the reservation and I was told the hotels cannot bebooked w o including the passes). If you do not stay at a Disney hotel, I would next highly recommend staying at a hotel on the RER line...it was SO much easier to get on and off the train than it ever was to take the bus! I would skip the non Disney 'in the Magic' hotels.",Disneyland_Paris
2450090,2,missing,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is a great place to spend time with your children if you are ready to pay a lot of money for an experience that, on my opinion, is hardly worth it. The stuff is quite friendly but... it  s all about money. The more you buy, the more they smile. It is not exactly an environment protecting company either... I strongly advice you to skip  the Disney Magic  and to take your kids out in a forest to explore real animals and real nature.",Disneyland_Paris
2448439,2,missing,United Kingdom,"This was my first trip to Disneyland and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience with my children.We walked for hours, tried every ride and attraction and had lots of fun.The best place to see the characters is at a dinner or breakfast or book in for a meal at Cafe Mickey. We had a great night and the best meal we had during our visit.We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which has excellent facilities and is very near the park. The park staff are pleasant and helpful.However, visitors should also be aware of some of the down sides as they could spoil your holiday experience.The adult visitors from Spain and France are extremely rude and think nothing of pushing young children out of the way to secure their own view of the parades etc. The service in the restaurants is dire (unsmiling and grumpy) and the toilets throughout the park are disgusting.There were large queues for the shows so you need to get to the line early if you want to see them   they are well worth the wait though.The worst thing though was Charles De Gaulle airport   Terminal 1. It was very dirty and worn. The toilets are few in number and very dirty. Their are very few facilities if your plane is delayed   no cafe or facilities within the security area.I would not return to Paris again but am now planning a trip to America   something I didn't think I would want to do.",Disneyland_Paris
2381607,5,missing,Ireland,"I don't know where to begin   this was my first time EVER at any Disneyland and it was INCREDIBLE!! The inner child in me took over as soon as we arrived, I loved it!! We got there for about 9:30am on Monday 2nd August 2004 and had no problem with queues. We did all the rides immediately and took fastpass tickets for later on if we decided to do them again! For lunch we grabbed a hotdog and coke from a vendor near the Phantom Mansion   delicious!! Then we looked around the shops on Main St USA   too many things to take in, i was nearly racing young kids to get to the toys! We did lots of shopping   I don't feel guilty yet because I haven't received my credit card bill : )Then we got the invisible stamp on our hands and took the metro out to Val d'Europe to Sea Life   it was alright, it is in the shopping centre at the very end a its a long walk on sore feet! bit pricey in but we got our tickets at the information centre in Disneyland for slightly cheaper. It's not all that great to be honest but we got to see little sharks so it wasnt bad!Then we hopped on the metro back to disneyland and continued our shopping spree. Once all shopped out we took the train around the park, got to see some great views. We also got on the steamboat in frontierland and went around the lake, it was so much fun!For dinner we went to the Rainforest Cafe in Disney Village, I'd heard great things about it and was curious! First of all the decor was fantastic, gorillas on the walls and vines on the ceiling, thunder and lightning etc! The staff were sooo nice and the service was great and quick! The food was reasonably priced and delicious. We got large helpings and actually had to stuggle with the YUMMY desserts!After dinner we caught the end of the parade on main street and saw Pooh and friends singing on stage. Around 10pm we decided not to wait for the fireworks and head off!All in all it was amazing and I would love to go again   only negative was that I thought the French were incredibly rude. The staff in Disney were great but around paris and even other visitors at the park were very very rude   but thats just an opinion. Go to Disneyland   with or without kids   it really is the happiest place on earth!!!! :0)",Disneyland_Paris
